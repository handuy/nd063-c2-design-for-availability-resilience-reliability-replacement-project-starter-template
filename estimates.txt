1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage 
If a multi-AZ configuration is set up, the time that it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds.
    
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Because we setup a cross-region read replica, we can promote that replica to be a new DB instance. The promotion process can take several minutes or longer to complete, depending on the size of the read replica 

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Because we setup multi-AZ and multi-AZ uses synchronous replication, we can expect near zero RPO   
       
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
Because we setup a cross-region read replica and read replica uses asynchronous replication, we can expect a few minutes of RPO since there is replication lag time between regions.
